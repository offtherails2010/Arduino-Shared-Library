Projects herein are available freely for all

Keeping OPEN SOURCE truly transparent and as it should be - free of charge, as in, free-beer, lol

Also a lot of very hard work has gone into these projects, if you use any code or Schematics/PCB Designs,
a little thank you and acknowledgement would be greatly appreciated :)

Both myself and L.O.G thank you in advance for any 'constructive' comments you may wish to share, 

as mother taught me if you havent got anything nice to say, rather ya dont say anything then !

Enjoy :)
